== Description ==

## Googlebot Monitor features

This plugin allows you to monitor bots such as used by Google or Bing and dump the data into Google Analytics. In this way, access to key information from the server logs is easier. The track is automatic, and does not require any action by the team managing the server or web development.

Log analysis can help you understand if search engines are visiting all pages or if some pages are having crawling problems.

1. Create a new property in your GA account (IMPORTANT: NEVER use the same Google Analytics UA-XXXXX that you usually use for tracking)
2. Enter the UA of the new property in the plugin options.
3. You can extend the regular expression to register additional bots (Advanced users only)
